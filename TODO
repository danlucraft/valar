 o complex type conversions
 o iterators for array
 o Make use of the faster type checks FIXNUM_P.
 o Data members can be nullable
 o Data members should increment reference counts where appropriate, 
   and should 'mark' Ruby VALUEs. (This has to do with the 'weak' keyword,
   so learn about that.
 o Convert Structs.
