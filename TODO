 o fix string[] to free strings when returning from functions
 o HashMap<string/int, type>
 o dependencies to use .deps file
 o fix construction
 o iterators for array
 o Make use of the faster type checks FIXNUM_P.
 o Data members can be nullable
 o Data members should increment reference counts where appropriate, 
   and should 'mark' Ruby VALUEs. (This has to do with the 'weak' keyword,
   so learn about that.
 o Convert Structs.

 x all types should check for NULL and return nil if so.
 x fix string[] members
 x ArrayList<string> to Ruby.
 x constants
 x unichar conversions
 x signals
 x embedding example
 x Convert ENUMS
 x Vala bool type should convert to Ruby true/false
 x Convert data members
 x Convert constructors.
 x Convert properties appropriately.
 x Recognize types that are defined within the library itself.
 x make rval 2 gobj conversions happen even when the object is 
   the child of Glib.Object at any depth.
 x Nullable types.
