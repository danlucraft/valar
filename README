= valar

* http://github.com/danlucraft/valar/tree/master

== DESCRIPTION:

Includes a VAPI file for calling the Ruby API from Vala, and a 
code generator valar to introspect on a Vala library and automatically
generate bindings for Ruby.

Other features:

 * automated conversions between Vala and Ruby types
 * object oriented Ruby API. Instead of VALUE, VALUE, VALUE, you can
   write Ruby.Value, Ruby.Array, Ruby.String and enjoy automated type
   checking to rule out segfaults.

== REQUIREMENTS:

Technically none, but if you want to compile your vala code you will 
need valac and glib, and if you want to distribute the generated C, your
users will need glib.

== INSTALL:

* not yet.
