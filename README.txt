= valar

* http://github.com/danlucraft/valar/tree/master

== DESCRIPTION:

 * Write Ruby extensions in Vala. 
 * Automatically generate Ruby bindings for them.
 * Embed a Ruby interpreter into Vala.

Includes a VAPI file for calling the Ruby C API from Vala, and a 
code generator valar to introspect on a Vala library and automatically
generate bindings for Ruby.

Other features:

 * automated conversions between Vala and Ruby types
 * An object oriented Ruby API. Instead of RSTRING_PTR(str), 
   you write str.to_vala()
 * Ruby types. So instead of VALUE, VALUE, VALUE, you 
   write Ruby.Value, Ruby.Array, Ruby.String and enjoy automatically
   generated type checking to rule out segfaults.
 * Automated memory management, linked to the Ruby garbage collector.

== IMPORTANT NOTES

This is new software and there are various notes:

 * I have not yet been able to figure out how to wrap GLib types that
   do not descend from GObject, so Valar will not convert them yet.
 * Memory management for class data members is non existent, so don't
   use them except for the most basic types.
 * Valar currently ignores custom property getters and setters. They are 
   all translated the same way, possibly incorrectly.
 * It only generates .c files not .h files so circular function references 
   will probably cause failures. I'm getting around to it....


== REQUIREMENTS:

Technically none, but to compile your Vala code you will need Vala 
(latest SVN) and to compile the generated C you and your users will
need Ruby-Gnome2 and glib.

However, the only actually necessary part of Ruby-Gnome2 is the glib 
binding, and it should be possible to include that in future versions of 
Valar, removing the Ruby-Gnome2 dependency.

== INSTALL:

  * not yet

== USAGE

  To generate Ruby extension in C:
    ruby /path/to/valar/bin/valar path/to/code.vapi
